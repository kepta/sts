`1.` Created the Control Flow Graph manually and through 2 tools, namely: Control Flow Graph Factory Tool and Eclipse Flow graph generator.

| Tool | Whether the CFG drawn by us matches by respective tools|
|----|-----|
| Control Flow graph factory tool | No|
| Eclipse flow graph generator | Yes|

`2.` Test suites for various coverage criteria:

| Coverage criterion | Test vectors: { [x,y]* }+ | Expected results|
|--------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
|Statement| { [0,1], [1,0], [2,0] }| min = 2|
|Branch| { [1,1], [-1,-1] } , { [-1,-1], [2,-1] }| min = 1|
|Basic condition| { [6,5], [4,4], [5,4] }| min = 2|

`3.` Mutation Code:

The mutant that is not killed by any of the test cases given above is the following:

``` Javascript

for (i = 0; i < p.size(); ++i) {
  if( ((Point) p.get(i).y <))
}
```

The second change can be changing i=0 to i=1 on line 15:


``` Javascript

for (i = 1; i < p.size(); ++i) {
  if( ((Point) p.get(i).y === null))
}
```

However, there is a problem with this choice. The first loop finds the first point in the vector
with the minimum y value, and the second loop is there in order to search through all points
with this minimum y and find the one which has the maximum x value. So the first comparison
made in the loop (with i=0) is actually always unnecessary â€” in fact the second loop could start
with i=min+1 since min will always be the first point with the minimum y, and the second loop
should only be looking at subsequent points min + 1, min + 2 ...


`4.` Path coverage.

 - Both loops do not execute at all.
 `Test cases: {()}`

- The first loop does not execute at all and the second loop executes once.
 `Test cases: {(1,1)}`

- The first loop executes once and the second loop executes twice.
 `Test cases: {(1,2); (2,1)}
 {(2,1); (1,2)}`

-  The first loop executes twice and the second loop executes thrice.
 Therefore, the total number of test cases required are `28`.
